/// Races the Task against a Timer. Whichever settles first cancels the other,
/// so exactly one of these happens:
///   1. the Task finishes in time - its value (or Error) is forwarded;
///   2. the budget expires - the Task is cancelled and the returned Task fails
///      with Error::k_connection_timed_out;
///   3. the Task cancels itself, or an outer token cancels the race - the
///      returned Task cancels, and the Timer is torn down.
///
/// The timeout is reported on the Error channel rather than as Cancellation:
/// "we gave up waiting" is a different outcome from "someone cancelled us", and
/// only the Error channel can carry that distinction (Task's cancel channel is
/// restricted to a valueless Cancellation).
///
/// Structured completion still holds - WhenAny does not settle until both the
/// Task and the Timer have reached a terminal state - so the Task is never left
/// running past the point where this Task resumes its caller.
///
/// A zero budget is cooperative: the Task gets its first turn before libuv can
/// dispatch the zero-delay Timer. Work that completes without suspending wins;
/// once it suspends, the Timer is eligible on the next loop iteration.
///
/// For an absolute deadline, subtract at the point the work starts:
///
///   co_await with_timeout(step(), deadline - std::chrono::steady_clock::now());
///
/// Doing it there rather than through a wrapper keeps the budget honest. Tasks
/// are lazy, so a deadline converted when the wrapper is *built* would start
/// counting from then and overshoot if the wrapper is scheduled later.
