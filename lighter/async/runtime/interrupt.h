/// Turns "the user wants us to stop" into Cancellation.
///
/// A long-running program has two different reactions to process-control
/// events. Some mean stop and some are merely observable. Fatal events fire a
/// CancellationToken, while every event also stays observable through next().
///
/// Typical use:
///
///   EventLoop loop;
///   auto interrupts = InterruptSource::create(loop).value();
///   loop.schedule(with_token(run_agent_turn(), interrupts.token()));
///
/// Cancellation is sticky: once a fatal signal has arrived the token stays
/// cancelled, and Tasks wrapped afterwards cancel immediately. This is
/// deliberate - a second turn should not start after the user asked to quit.
///
/// The second Ctrl+C is special. The first should unwind cleanly; if cleanup
/// itself wedges, the user needs a way out that does not involve a process
/// killer. interrupt_count() reports how many fatal signals have arrived so a
/// caller can escalate:
///
///   if (interrupts.interrupt_count() >= 2) std::exit(130);
///
/// Platform note: Windows console controls are represented directly rather
/// than disguised as POSIX signals. Terminal resize is a TerminalEvent, not a
/// process interrupt.
