# Reflection-driven mocking

`lighter::mock::Mock<Contract>` generates a callable mock port from either a
plain method contract or an `ngcpp-proxy` facade. The user declares each
operation only once and refers to that declaration when configuring behavior.
Ordinary data members on a plain contract are ignored.

```cpp
struct Files {
    int open_count = 0; // Not part of the generated port.

    std::string read(std::string_view path) const;
    void remove(std::string_view path) const;
};

lighter::mock::Mock<Files> files;
files.expect<^^Files::read>().returns("contents");
files.expect<^^Files::remove>().never();

run(files.handle());
files.verify();
```

The methods need declarations but not definitions. `Mock<Files>::Port` is a
generated aggregate with `read` and `remove` callable fields, normally backed
by `std::copyable_function`. Its call syntax matches the declared methods, so
it fits structurally injected dependencies and `ngcpp-proxy` targets. It is not
a `Files` object and cannot replace a concrete parameter of type `Files&`.

For an `ngcpp-proxy` facade, pass the facade directly and select operations by
their dispatch types. No parallel method-contract struct is needed:

```cpp
PRO_DEF_MEM_DISPATCH(ReadDispatch, read);
PRO_DEF_FREE_DISPATCH(RemoveDispatch, remove);
PRO_DEF_MEM_DISPATCH(FlushDispatch, flush);

struct FilesFacade
    : pro::facade_builder
          ::add_convention<ReadDispatch,
                           std::string(std::string_view) const>
          ::add_convention<RemoveDispatch,
                           void(std::string_view) const>
          ::add_direct_convention<FlushDispatch,
                                  void() const noexcept>
          ::build {};

lighter::mock::Mock<FilesFacade> files;
files.expect<ReadDispatch>().returns("contents");
files.expect<RemoveDispatch>().returns();
files.expect<FlushDispatch>().returns();

auto provider = files.handle();
provider->read("settings.json");
remove(*provider, "obsolete.json");
provider.flush();
files.verify();
```

`Mock` reflects `FilesFacade::convention_types` and reuses each dispatch's
generated accessor with an internal mock dispatch. This preserves the syntax
of indirect member, free-function, and direct conventions without duplicating
their declarations. For a facade, `handle()` returns a ready-to-use
`pro::proxy<FilesFacade>`.

Use `calls` when behavior depends on arguments or the result is move-only:

```cpp
files.expect<^^Files::read>().calls([](std::string_view path) {
    if (path != "settings.json") {
        throw std::runtime_error("unexpected path");
    }
    return std::string("{}");
});
```

`expect` expects one call by default. Override that with `times`, `once`, or
`never`. Use `allow` to install behavior without constraining the call count.
Ordered `then_calls` and `then_returns` actions infer their expected count and
support one-shot move-only results. `verify` reports every unmet expectation.

`handle()` returns an owning port value for a plain contract and a
`pro::proxy<Facade>` for a facade. Its dispatchers share ownership of their
state, so handles may outlive the movable mock controller. A plain-contract
port can also be copied independently. Facade handles support `none`,
`nontrivial`, and `nothrow` copy constraints; trivial copying is incompatible
with their shared ownership.

`Port` is intentionally an implementation detail of `Mock`. Production APIs
should express their boundary as a facade or as a constrained generic
interface rather than naming the generated function table. A generated port
can satisfy such a structural interface or be stored in an `ngcpp-proxy`.

## Design boundaries

- Plain contracts require one non-overloaded ordinary member operation per
  name. Facade conventions may be indirect member, free-function, or direct,
  but each dispatch currently needs exactly one overload signature. The mock
  generates conditional accessor bases for the pointee and pointer wrapper so
  each convention is present on the object where `ngcpp-proxy` expects it.
- `noexcept` operations are supported when their result is `void` or
  nothrow-default-constructible. Their `calls` and `then_calls`
  implementations must be nothrow-invocable. Because an exception cannot
  escape such a call, immediate mock violations are recorded and reported by
  `verify()`; an unconfigured non-void call returns `R{}` in the meantime.
- Volatile and ref-qualified operations are rejected because the generated
  aggregate needs one callable field per operation.
- `std::function_ref` is deliberately not used for port fields. It is
  non-owning and non-default-constructible, so a returned or coroutine-stored
  handle could outlive the controller and dangle.
- Port dispatchers use `std::copyable_function`. Move-only configured behavior
  is still supported because actions are owned separately by the mock state;
  making the generated handle itself move-only would add restrictions without
  enabling another use case.
- `returns(value)` requires a non-reference, copyable result because the same
  behavior may run repeatedly. `then_returns(value)` accepts move-only results
  because each ordered action runs once. Use callables for reference results.
- Arguments are not copied into an implicit history. Assert on them inside
  `calls`; this avoids surprising copies, dangling references, and loss of
  move-only arguments.
- Verification is explicit. Destructors do not throw and do not hide failures
  during stack unwinding.

C++26 reflection still cannot synthesize member functions. A plain contract's
generated port therefore remains an aggregate of callable data members. Facade
mocking avoids that restriction by instantiating the accessors already
generated by the facade dispatch declarations.
